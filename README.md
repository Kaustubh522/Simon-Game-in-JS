# Simon-Game-in-JS
This is a game of Simon built in HTML, CSS and JS. In the drop-down menu, you can select a number. On clicking the Start button, the four squares on the screen will light up that many times, in a particular sequence. You have to remember that sequence, and then click on the squares in the correct order. If you do it correctly, all the colours will light up. If you fail, a message that you lost will be displayed on the screen.

The game has been created in HTML, using CSS to create the squares and JavaScript to manage the logic of the game.
